# GoW Script Loader & Gameplay Tweaks
# Source code: <TBD>
#
# This is a BETA release. Expect bugs.

#
# *** MAIN SETTINGS ***
#
[General]
EnableDebugMenu = true              # Enable the debug menu. Toggled with the hotkey below ('~' by default).
DebugMenuFontScale = 1.0            # Change the global font scale in the debug menu.

[Gameplay]
SkipIntroLogos = true               # Skip the intro logo movies on game startup.
RemoveDepthOfField = false          # Disable the depth of field post-processing effect.
UnlockPhotomodeCamera = false       # Remove the camera restrictions when using photo mode.
OverrideCameraFov = false           # Force a specific field of view for the third person camera. Does not apply to photo mode.
CameraFov = 90.0                    # Field of view value to use. Game default is 74.

#
# *** HOTKEYS (KEYBINDS) ***
#
# Each hotkey maps to one of the Windows virtual key codes in hexadecimal format. To disable a keybind, set its value to -1.
# You can find a list of keys here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes
#
[Hotkeys]
ToggleDebugUI = 0xC0                # '~'  key. Toggles the main menu bar and cursor.
ToggleFreeflyCamera = 0x75          # 'F6' key. Toggles the freefly camera.
ToggleNoclip = 0x74                 # 'F5' key. Toggles noclip.

#
# *** LUA ***
#
# Lua source files will be loaded from the "lua" subdirectory next to this configuration file (typically "GodOfWar/mods/lua"). Any
# dumped scripts will have the file extension ".lua.bin" and require decompilation with a tool such as unluac. Script compilation
# errors will be logged to the debug console. Also note that game updates have a tendency to modify lua scripts.
#
[Lua]
LoadScripts = true                  # Enable runtime loading and compilation of lua scripts.
DumpScripts = false                 # Enable runtime dumping of lua bytecode files.
